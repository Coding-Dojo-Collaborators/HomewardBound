    <h1>about Us</h1>
    <p>Founded in February 2022, we started this web application as a project for Coding Dojo. We were encouraged to create something meaningful and what better cause than helping animals find their perfect person. 

During the height of quarantine, many people adopted animals and when the quarantine was lifted, a lot of these animals ended up in shelters. Most of the animals that can't find homes are transferred to high kill facilities that are euthanizing due to lack of space. Many have been abused, neglected, or abandoned. 

Our app carefully matches with prospective adopters using our matchmaking quiz so we can increase the certainty that they find their loving, forever homes. Like people, animals have distinct personalities that make them unique. Find your match today.
